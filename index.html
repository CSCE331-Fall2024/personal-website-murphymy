                            &emsp;My name is Myles Murphy, and I'm a Junior at <a class="aboutLinks" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Texas A&M University</a> majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics and Music. When I first enrolled at A&M, I had not been exposed to any computer science topics or coding, so I planned on pursuing an engineering major. After taking an introductory Python course, I realized how much I enjoyed the logic and way of thinking that goes into programming, so I decided to become a Computer Science major.

                            &emsp;I'm currently continuing my summer internship with Hexagon Asset Lifecycle Intelligence as a part-time software development intern, where I'm assisting with the migration of legacy software from C++ to C#. During the summer, I worked with the Asset Model Development team to develop several PDF data collection scripts for the PAS Integrity software suite. This was the first time I worked in a professional environment and with a team as a software developer. Approaching such a large codebase was a scary experience at first, but it was also exciting to contribute to a meaningful project. I highly recommend checking out all the software solutions offered by Hexagon ALI, they can be found <a class="aboutLinks" href="https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/asset-lifecycle-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

                            &emsp;Outside of school and work, I can often be found playing the piano. I have been playing classical piano for around 14 years, and I find playing piano after a long day the best way to de-stress and relax. My love for the piano is largely why I am pursuing a minor in Music, as I can continue studying music theory and piano performance. I take a lot of inspiration from <a class="aboutLinks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glenn Gould</a>, an eccentric 20th-century Canadian pianist, because of his unique interpretations of Bach's works. My repertoire mostly consists of pieces from the Baroque and Romantic periods. I'm currently learning Edvard Grieg's <a class="aboutLinks" href="https://youtu.be/eV0w7ufts9w?si=XkQ4OHnR0bGophoj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piano Sonata, Op. 7</a>.
